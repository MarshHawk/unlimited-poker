# Play

1. All players subscribe to deal event with user and table token:
2. Deal Event is called manually (TODO: triggered by some as yet undetermined threshhold)
3. Players subscribe to hand event channel with user and hand token
4. Players send events for the hand in order based on actions received from the channels
5. Players receive player events, street change events, and hand/table over events
